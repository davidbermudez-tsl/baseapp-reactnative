## Tech

- React Native
- NativeBase - Great component UI boilerplate highly themeable/customizable
- TypeScript
- React Query
- Redux - To handle client global state
- Formik
- Axios

## :arrow_forward: Setup

- If this is your first time setting up a Bare React Native Project, you might need to setup your environment by following the instructions in the [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## IMPORTANT

This project does not use expo so make sure you are following the "React Native CLI" Steps.

## :arrow_forward: Usage

It's important to start your application with the name it's gonna have, as this will be more difficult to change once the application is deployed.

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template git@bitbucket.org:silverlogic/baseapp-reactnative.git
```

Make sure to chage MyApp for your real App Name
